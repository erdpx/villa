## Implementation Notes
1. ZCoordLoss - Simple constraint on Z coordinate, similar to existing implementations
2. LinChkDistLoss - Implementation matches C++ version with sqrt(abs(diff)) calculation
3. ZLocationLoss - Interpolates a point from a matrix and computes error between interpolated Z and target Z
   - Implemented bilinear interpolation in PyTorch to match OpenCV's interp_lin_2d
   - Correctly handles out-of-bounds access by checking matrix dimensions
4. SurfaceLossD - Interpolates a 3D point from a matrix at a given location and computes the error between the interpolated point and the target point
   - Extension of ZLocationLoss to handle all 3 coordinates (x, y, z) instead of just z
   - Provides two Jacobians: one for the point (negative identity) and one for the location (derivatives of bilinear interpolation)
5. SpaceLossAcc - Samples a 3D volume at a point location and uses the interpolated value as the error
   - Includes a custom TrilinearInterpolator that performs the same trilinear interpolation as the C++ CachedChunked3dInterpolator
   - Supports two modes: minimizing the interpolated value (finding minima) or maximizing it (finding maxima)
   - Computes appropriate gradients for optimization in both modes
   - Particularly useful for finding boundaries or features in volumetric data
6. AnchorLoss - Combines volume sampling with point-to-point distance constraint
   - Uses the TrilinearInterpolator to sample a 3D volume at an anchor point
   - Computes a two-part error: volume term (clipped and squared difference from 1.0) and distance term
   - Useful for anchoring points to specific regions in a volume while maintaining distance constraints
   - Provides Jacobians for both the point and the anchor point
   - During optimization, points tend to move closer together while anchors move to regions with higher values
7. SpaceLineLossAcc - Samples multiple points along a line and aggregates interpolated values
   - Uses the TrilinearInterpolator to sample a 3D volume at multiple points along a line
   - Line is defined by two endpoints (both optimization variables)
   - Samples at a specified number of steps along the line (default 5)
   - Supports both minimizing (finding valleys) and maximizing (finding ridges) modes
   - Provides Jacobians that properly weight the influence of each endpoint based on position
   - During optimization, endpoints tend to move to position the line through regions of interest

## Implementation Achievements
- Successfully implemented all 12 cost functions from the C++ codebase
- Created a reusable TrilinearInterpolator class that replaces C++ interpolation functionality
- Maintained mathematical equivalence to C++ implementations while using idiomatic PyTorch
- Provided comprehensive test coverage for all cost functions
- Added support for batch processing via PyTorch tensors
- Made optimization mode (minimize/maximize) more explicit than in the C++ version

## Future Improvements
- Enhance the TrilinearInterpolator with CUDA support for GPU acceleration
- Add more vectorized operations to avoid for-loops in performance-critical paths
- Create additional examples and demos showing how to combine multiple cost functions
